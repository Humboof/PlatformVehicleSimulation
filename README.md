# Platform Vehicle Simulation
![animated gif of vehicle simulation](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/GrandioseAnimatedGeese-size_restricted.gif)

A physics simulation of a platform with four engines. This project features:

 - Fully physics-based simulation with no scripted parameters (the craft moves only as a result of the engines' thrust)
 - Self-leveling stabilization system which dynamically adjusts thrust at each of the engines to keep the craft stable
 - Impact test which drops weights at a random point on the platform to attempt to destabilize it
 - Controls which can pilot the craft simply by modifying the magnitude of thrust at each of the engines

## Instructions

### Piloting the Craft
![image of platform controls](https://alphastatus.net/images/controls.jpg)
Use the mouse to click and drag each of the sliders to control either the pitch, roll, or the throttle.

### Impact Testing
Right click anywhere on the screen to drop weights at a random point on the platform.

### Camera Rotation
The camera view can be rotated by clicking and dragging anywhere on the screen.
